The guezz is the name of a web based social game about sports predictions. 

The unique ingredient of The Guezz is that, contrary to betting sites, you win when you beat your friends at doing accurate predictions.

This app is a simple prototype to test a new set of rules of the game.

The app basically covers:

1. Player registration.
2. PLayer scores management (only available for the admin) and consultation (public).
